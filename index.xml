An overfitting model/algorithm is too complex for the task or dataset at hand while An underfitting model is too simple for the task If overfitting has ever cost you downward jumps on a machine learning competition, you might agree with me that the experience was somewhat humiliating especially if you went from top 3 downwards, when you had better and stronger non-overfitting submissions that you didn&amp;rsquo;t select to be scored on.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://lyraxvincent.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lyraxvincent.github.io/about/</guid><description>about page</description></item><item><title/><link>https://lyraxvincent.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lyraxvincent.github.io/contact/</guid><description>contact page</description></item></channel></rss>
