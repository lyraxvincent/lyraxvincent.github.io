# **Hi** <img src="/img/about/hi.gif" width="50"/>
Welcome to my online portfolio and blog.

I'm Vincent, a result-oriented data scientist and machine learning engineer with a data-driven mindset and attention to details. Ready to work and willing to learn and meet new challenges in a diverse and fast-paced working environment that appreciates my skills and offers avenues for growth.
Competent in executing data mining, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, data story telling, data visualization, feature engineering, machine learning modeling and model deployment. Extensive experience in supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and concepts. Proficiency in Windows and Linux operating systems.
An all-round data analytics practitioner greatly passionate about artificial intelligence and python programming with an aim of becoming a world class problem solver.

## **Recent Achievements** <img src="/img/about/projects.gif" width="75"/>

-----

- Packaged machine learning code into a forecasting python package enabling the machine learning team to run forecasts with a few lines of code using a pipeline similar to scikit-learnâ€™s API.

- Led a pilot project to predict estimated time of arrival for vessels ferrying shipments from Vietnam to Western Africa.

- Built a stocks price prediction and analysis app for Kenyan stocks. ([Link](https://stockswatch.streamlit.app))

- Built my online portfolio website and blog. ([Link](https://lyraxvincent.github.io/))

- Did a machine learning project about sentiment analysis covering a full project cycle from data acquisition to model deployment. Data scraping from twitter, text modeling using word vector representation with the bag of words and tfidf models and hosted a web application on streamlit cloud.
  - [Link](https://sentlysis.streamlit.app) to wep application.
  - [Link](https://github.com/lyraxvincent/sentiment-analysis) to project code on github.

- Designed a python package called **datastand** to help data scientists, machine learning engineers and data  analysts better understand data. It gives quick insights about given data; general dataset statistics, size and shape of the dataset, number of unique data types, number of numerical and non-numerical columns, a small overview of the dataset, missing data statistics, missing data heatmap, and provides methodologies to impute missing data.
  - [Link](https://pypi.org/project/datastand/) to package on PyPI.
  - [Link](https://lyraxvincent.github.io/post/datastand-apython-package-for-data-explorers/) to blog article on how to get started using the package.

Datastand is a python package designed to help Data
Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Analysts to better understand
data. It gives quick insights about given data; general dataset statistics, size and
shape of dataset, number of unique data types, number of numerical and non-
numerical columns, small overview of dataset, missing data statistics, missing data
heatmap and provides methodology to impute missing data.
Package link on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/datastand/)
I also made a guide to showcase how datastand works and help you get started [here.](https://lyraxvincent.github.io/post/datastand-a-python-package-for-data-explorers/)
