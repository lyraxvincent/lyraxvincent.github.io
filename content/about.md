# **Hi**ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my online portfolio and blog.

I'm Vincent, a result-oriented data scientist and machine learning engineer with a data-driven mindset and attention
to details. Ready to work and willing to learn and meet new challenges in a diverse and fast-paced
working environment.
Competent in executing data mining, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, data story telling, data
visualization, feature engineering, data modeling and model deployment. Extensive experience in
supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and concepts. Proficiency in Windows and
Linux operating systems.
An all-round data analytics practitioner greatly passionate about artificial intelligence and python
programming with an aim of becoming a world class problem solver.

Here's a little more about me:

## **Projects**

-----

- <u>Sentiment Analysis Web App</u>  
This project was aimed at predicting the sentiment associated with tweets during
the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Covered a whole project cycle from data acquisition to model deployment. 
The whole project cycle details and code on my [github](https://github.com/lyraxvincent/sentiment-analysis)  
The project's web application is live [here.](https://sentlysis.herokuapp.com)


## **Publications**

-----

- <u>Python Package [datastand](https://pypi.org/project/datastand/) </u>  
Datastand is a python package designed to help Data
Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Analysts to better understand
data. It gives quick insights about given data; general dataset statistics, size and
shape of dataset, number of unique data types, number of numerical and non-
numerical columns, small overview of dataset, missing data statistics, missing data
heatmap and provides methodology to impute missing data.  
Package link on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/datastand/)  
I also made a guide to showcase how datastand works and help you get started [here.](https://lyraxvincent.github.io/post/datastand-a-python-package-for-data-explorers/)
