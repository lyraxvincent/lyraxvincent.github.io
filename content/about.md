## **Projects**

-----

- <u>Sentiment Analysis Web App</u>  
This project was aimed at predicting the sentiment associated with tweets during
the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Covered a whole project cycle from data acquisition to model deployment. 
The whole project cycle details and code on my [github](https://github.com/lyraxvincent/sentiment-analysis)  
The project's web application is live [here.](https://sentlysis.herokuapp.com)


## **Publications**

-----

- <u>Python Package [datastand](https://pypi.org/project/datastand/) </u>  
Datastand is a python package designed to help Data
Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Analysts to better understand
data. It gives quick insights about given data; general dataset statistics, size and
shape of dataset, number of unique data types, number of numerical and non-
numerical columns, small overview of dataset, missing data statistics, missing data
heatmap and provides methodology to impute missing data.  
Package link on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/datastand/)  
I also made a guide to showcase how datastand works and help you get started [here.]()
